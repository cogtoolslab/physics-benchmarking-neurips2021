**Researchers**: 

## Study information
<!-- give your study a brief and informative title -->
**Title**: 

### Research questions
<!-- specify the broad and specific questions guiding your study -->

### Hypotheses
<!-- list 2 specific, concise, and testable hypotheses, including the if-then logic statements for your predictions. -->
 
## Design Plan
###   Study type
 <!-- indicate whether your study will be experimental or correlational -->
###   Study design
 <!-- describe the overall design of the study (what will be manipulated and/or measured, specify whether manipulations will be between- or within-subjects, etc.) -->
 
Sampling Plan
###   Data collection procedure
 <!-- describe the method you will use to collect your data, and your inclusion/exclusion criteria. This should include your sampling frame, how participants will be recruited, and whether/how they will be compensated. -->
###   Sample size
 <!-- indicate your target sample size and why that is your target (might be based in past research, for example) -->
###   Stopping rule
 <!-- specify how you will determine when to stop data collection -->
 
Variables
###   Manipulated variables
 <!-- If applicable, precisely define any variables you plan to manipulate, including the levels and whether the manipulation will be between or within subjects. -->
###   Measured variables
 <!-- Precisely define each variable that you will measure. This includes outcome measures, as well as other measured predictor variables. -->
###   Indices
 <!-- If applicable, define how measures will be combined into an index (or even a mean) and what measures will be used. Include a formula or a precise description of the method. -->
 
Analysis Plan
###   Data exclusion
 <!-- How will you determine which data points or samples (if any) to exclude from your analyses? How will outliers be handled? Will you use any awareness or attention check? -->
###   Missing data
 <!-- How will you deal with incomplete or missing data -->
###   Planned visualization
 <!-- Describe what kind of visualization you would use (e.g. boxplot, faceted histogram, scatterplot, etc.) to evaluate your data and determine what it can tell you about your research question -->
###   Predicted results
 <!-- What pattern do you expect to see in your planned visualization, based on the hypotheses you described earlier? -->
###   Exploratory analysis
 <!-- If you plan to explore your data to look for unspecified differences or relationships, you may include those plans here. If you list an exploratory test here, you are not obligated to report its results, but you are obligated to describe it as an exploratory result. -->
